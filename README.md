# Company-Goes-Bankrupt-or-not---Classification-Project
Introduction:-

This is a classification project in which the predictions will be about knowing to which class a certain observation belongs to. There can be two classes or more than two classes. The current case involves only two classes which makes this a binary classification.

As for any machine learning project, the first step will be the Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA. In EDA the data will be analyzed in detail. Here we will check for missing or null values, any errors in the entries or their data types, data distributions in all the columns, presence of any outliers, and check for correlations.

If any of the above are found to be out of the normal, they will be dealt with here before proceeding to model building.

About the problem:-

Here there are certain variables pertaining to 250 companies with each row or observation belonging to each company. These variables will tell us whether the company will go bankrupt or not. These variables are:

Industrial Risk
Management Risk
Financial Flexibility
Credibility
Competitiveness
Operating Risk
These variables has values ranging between 0 to 1 with 0 being low, 0.5 being medium, and 1 being high based on the columns purpose. The combination of these variables will tell us whether that company will go bankrupt or not. And these results are stored in the Class column.

The goal here is to build some classification models that will be trained on this data and will make predictions on new data.
